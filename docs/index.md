# Welcome to my GitHub page!

There's not much on here at the moment, there might not be for a while. 

So until I change anything, this cat will be dancing for all eternity.

### Current interests ðŸ¤”

I am currently interested in a variety of topics related to automation and software development. Specifically, I have been focusing on learning more about GitHub actions, I have been using them to automate a variety of tasks, such as building and deploying code, deploying docker containers and more. In addition to my interest in automation, I have also been focusing on improving my skills with Git.

I'm also improving my skills navigating around a Linux CLI, and learning more about C++.
